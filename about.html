        <h1>Artist . Sculptor </h1>
        <p class="lead">Just over two years ago from his home in a secluded, deeply verdant corner of Kerala, Zack began chipping away on a piece of granite that he had found while driving past a quarry. That piece grew into a series of sculptures, each a development and progression from the last. Since then, his interest in granite and stone grew to include finely grained stones from Rajasthan and Jaipur, creating a body of work that at times blurs the line between the artistâ€™s hand and the audience eye, so fluid is the expression.   </p>
